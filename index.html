      <div id="counter2"> <h5>In 1830 pizza truly began with the opening of the
        world’s first pizzeria. Named Port’Alba, the pizzas were cooked in an
        oven lined with lava from Mount Vesuvius, a volcano located on the Bay
        of Naples. </h5> </div>


      <div id="counter3"> <h5>In the 1800s, most Italians thought of pizza as a
        peasant meal. That changed when a baker named Raffaele Esposito created
        a margarita pizza for visiting royalty. The king and queen were impressed
        by the colors of the Italian flag represented by the pizza’s white mozzarellacheese,
        red tomato sauce, and green basil. Pizza became fashionable overnight and was
        soon a staple in restaurants all across the country. </h5> </div>


      <div id="counter4"> <h5> There are approximately 61,269 pizzerias in the
        United States. </h5> </div>

         pie was cut into 94,248 slices and eaten by more than 30,000 spectators
         at the baking in Havana, Florida.</h5> </div>

      <div id="counter6"> <h5>Americans eat approximately 350 slices of pizza per
